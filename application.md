## Topic Preference

1. Efficient Ensembling for Instance Segmentation using Multi-input Multi-output (MIMO) Architectures
2. Towards More Advanced and Understood B-cos Networks
3. Topic Name: Rotation Invariant Vision Transformers

TODO: Preference explanation

The first topic interests us the most as we find the MIMO architecture intriguing and we are genuinely interested in improving the the accuracy and uncertainty estimation of Mark R-CNN with little computational overhead.

The second topic is also interesting to us since interpretability is a well known problem in DNN approaches. The results in the B-cos paper seem really impressive. The paper mentions integration into vision transformers as one open question and we are certainly interested in that among other advancements.

The last topic interests us as rotation invariant classification seems like a genreal task which many computer vision problems can benefit from.

## Motivation

TODO: Add motivation for course

As a working student at ISRA vision, Parth has been always inclined to computer vision tasks. He is a part of machine vision team and is working on vision tasks based on deep learning and is also working on his master thesis on image segementation. Thus taking this course will give him an exposure to current state of the art research techniques that can be applied to solve more pratical industry problems and will also assist him in his master thesis.

Mario is motivated to take the course as he plans to write his master's thesis in the following semester at a computer vision lab at EPFL in Switzerland with co-supervision from the Visual Inference Lab. This lab would be a fantastic opportunity to gather additional experience in working in a scientific environment before a master's thesis.



## Prior experience

TODO: Add experience

Parth has good command in theory as well as hands-on since he also has his own Youtube channel(with more than 3k followers) where he provides lecture on deep leanring and Data science topics. Parth has worked on computer vision tasks in his internship at Spryfox GmbH where implemented fabric defect detection and classification using ResNet. Apart from that Parth and Kamyar worked on deep learning project for bitcoin price prediction and also wrote paper under Prof. Zoubir. Apart from that, Parth has experience in GANs model which he worked on, to generate artificial images from scratch for data balancing. His current wins at ISRA vision GmbH includes the adaptive gamma correction approach for defects that looks distorted due to various illumination conditions and patterns on car bodies and this resulted in the accuracy increment by 3%. He also took computer vision 1 course by Prof. Roth. His github portfolio is : https://github.com/Parth527 where you can look at various other projects from NLP and machine learning domains.  

Mario visited the lectures "Machine Learning" and "3D Vision and Deep Learning" at Johannes Gutenberg University which were centered around the principles of machine learning and computer vision using DNNs respectively. 
In his bachelor's thesis, he tried to correct erroneous bases in large collections of sequenced DNA reads with a CNN ([source code](https://github.com/MaHeNow/Deep-Care)).
Mario also visited both CV1 and CV2 lectures in the last two semesters held by Professor Roth.
In his free time, Mario was working on a crypto currency price prediction algorithm using recurrent neural networks.
