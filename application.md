## Topic Preference

1. Efficient Ensembling for Instance Segmentation using Multi-input Multi-output (MIMO) Architectures
2. Towards More Advanced and Understood B-cos Networks
3. Topic Name: Rotation Invariant Vision Transformers

TODO: Preference explanation

The first topic interests us the most as we find the MIMO architecture intriguing and we are genuinely interested in improving the the accuracy and uncertainty estimation of Mark R-CNN with little computational overhead. This is a practical task in our idea, and the structure of the workload is the best among others.

The second topic is also interesting to us since interpretability is a well known problem in DNN approaches. The results in the B-cos paper seem really impressive. The paper mentions integration into vision transformers as one open question and we are certainly interested in that among other advancements. We also think it could be a break through in Deep Learning, which highly motivates us.

The last topic interests us as rotation invariant classification seems like a genreal task which many computer vision problems can benefit from. Especially, since transformers have been dominating the DL era ever since their intoroduction, and they always been showing promissing results.

## Motivation

TODO: Add motivation for course

As a working student at ISRA vision, **Parth** has been always inclined to computer vision tasks. He is a part of machine vision team and is working on vision tasks based on deep learning. Taking this course will give him an exposure to current state of the art research techniques that can be applied to solve more pratical industry problems.

**Mario** is motivated to take the course as he plans to write his master's thesis in the following semester at a computer vision lab at EPFL in Switzerland with co-supervision from the Visual Inference Lab. This lab would be a fantastic opportunity to gather additional experience in working in a scientific environment before a master's thesis.

**Kamyar** has always been mostly interested in CV applications of ML since halfway through his B.Sc., and he has been trying to expose himself to various practical cases of CV by completing different projects, for instance Object Detection using YOLO, Neural Style Transfer, and Image generation using GANs to name a few. By selecting this Project-Lab he is willing to get out of his comfort zone as much as possible to experience working with cutting-edge methods and the state-of-the-art in CV to learn as much as possible and contribute to the comunity.


## Prior experience

TODO: Add experience

**Parth** has good command in theory as well as hands-on since he also has his own Youtube channel(with more than 3k followers) where he provides lecture on deep leanring and Data science topics. Parth has worked on computer vision tasks in his internship at Spryfox GmbH where implemented fabric defect detection and classification using ResNet. Apart from that Parth and Kamyar worked on deep learning project for bitcoin price prediction and also wrote paper under Prof. Zoubir. Apart from that, Parth has experience in GANs model which he worked on, to generate artificial images from scratch for data balancing. His current wins at ISRA vision GmbH includes the adaptive gamma correction approach for defects that looks distorted due to various illumination conditions and patterns on car bodies and this resulted in the accuracy increment by 3%. He also took computer vision 1 course by Prof. Roth. His github portfolio is : https://github.com/Parth527 where you can look at various other projects from NLP and machine learning domains.  

**Mario** visited the lectures "Machine Learning" and "3D Vision and Deep Learning" at Johannes Gutenberg University which were centered around the principles of machine learning and computer vision using DNNs respectively. 
In his bachelor's thesis, he tried to correct erroneous bases in large collections of sequenced DNA reads with a CNN ([source code](https://github.com/MaHeNow/Deep-Care)).
Mario also visited both CV1 and CV2 lectures in the last two semesters held by Professor Roth.
In his free time, Mario was working on a crypto currency price prediction algorithm using recurrent neural networks.


**Kamyar** has always focused on both theory and implementation with hands-on projects in CV and ML, he has been constantly learning in the respective fields, for instance he has completed the Deep Learning Specialization of [Deeplearning.ai](Deeplearning.ai) and some other courses, besides attendding the "CV1" and "CV2" lectures of previous semesters offered by Prof. Roth. Furthermore, he has attended both "Data Science 1" lecture and the seminar "Data Science 2", and in the later Kamyar and Parth co-authored a paper (submitted) under Prof. Zoubir. 
He has been working as a Machine Learning Engineer at the FB20 Prof. Dr.-Ing. Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi System Security Lab under Hossein Fereidooni Ph. D. for more than 7 months, working on Deep Fake and Voice Cloning. (Due to confidentiality of the details and the projects still ongoing unfortunately I am unable to provide the github repo)
He has also co-founded a research-educational group ([AIDa Group telegram group](https://t.me/aidateam)) before joining TUD as a master's student back in Iran, in which he has been the instructor of multiple machine learning and deep learning courses. Additionally, he worked on Applications of Image Denosing using Deep Learning in his B.Sc. thesis under Dr. Reza Asvadi, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran.
